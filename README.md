or click on the "Releases" button in the GitHub repo.


alternatively:

1. Install Python 3.10.6 or newer. (Older versions probably also work)

2. Run PyGAME1.py

3. (If step 2. doesnt work, try opening the project in Visual Studio. This might fix issues)

4. also, you might have to install pygame idk.

( it runs on my PC, but probably not on your's. Because. )
